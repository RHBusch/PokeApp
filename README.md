# PokeApp

Objective:

The app will display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.

The app will  enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.

The app will have CSS styling.

The JavaScript code will  be formatted according to ESLint rules. --- May be formatted via Prettier or manually formatted. 

The app will  use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions --- the app may allow searching for items (pokemon)
